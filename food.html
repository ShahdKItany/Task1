    <h2> My Favourite Food</h2>

    <ul> 
        <li> Pizza</li>
        <p> Pizza was first invented in Naples, Italy as a fast, affordable, 
            tasty meal for working-class Neapolitans on the go. While we all know and love these slices of today, 
            pizza actually didn't gain mass appeal until the 1940s, 
            when immigrating Italians brought their classic slices to the United States.</p>

        <li> Shawarma </li>
        <p> Shawarma is a Middle Eastern dish that originated in the Ottoman Empire,
             consisting of meat cut into thin slices, stacked in an inverted cone, and roasted on a slowly turning vertical rotisserie or spit. 
            Traditionally made with lamb or mutton, it may also be made with chicken, turkey, beef, or veal</p>

        <li> Mcdonald</li>
        <p> McDonald's Corporation is an American multinational fast food chain, 
            founded in 1940 as a restaurant operated by Richard and Maurice McDonald, 
            in San Bernardino, California, United States.</p>
